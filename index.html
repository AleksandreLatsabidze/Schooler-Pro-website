                Team SchoolerPro was born out of the desperation, doubt and
                anxiety that affected schools when COVID19 became a reality. But
                it is designed to outlast not only outlast the pandemic but also
                re-imagine pedagogy for the New Generation of Students. Indian
                Schools, though may face a lot of criticism for the means of
                imparting education, they still remain the powerhouse of
                educating so many students.
              </p>
              <p class="sect_paragrph">
                At SchoolerPro, we believe that what the Schools need is a new
                age tool, that helps in managing content and making it
                seamlessly available for their students to consume. SchoolerPro
                is imagined as a platform that unites - Teacher, Students,
                Administrators, Third Party content creator with the sole aim of
                re-inventing a childs education. All this without burning the
                pockets of parents in a pay-as-you-go model.

                At SchoolerPro, we believe in creating tomorrows solutions for
                today. Education in India has always been a fast-paced industry
                where huge numbers are pitted against each other by institutions
                and upcoming EdTech Startups alike. We Beg to Differ. We are a
                platform that lets every teacher enhance her lesson and every
                student learn in a digital, real-world and scaleable way. Nature
                has already done a great job of already giving the kids a very
                plastic brain that just needs to be guided. We just have to keep
                feeding those guns and kids can imagine a world even better and
                smarter than us.

              <h2 class="imgsect_lasttext">
                Our logo emphasises our approach - Emphasise Application. Our
                logo is designed from a rather simple invention of a well known
                learned man. Pythagoras is so well known in India, thanks to his
                a^2 + b^2 = c^2 formula. In a poetically infamous way, this
                marks the single greatest rote-learned formula by many students
                in India. But Pythagoras is more than meets the eye. He loved
                the application of things with as much passion as he learned
                them. Our logo is based on a Pythagoras Cup. When filled under a
                certain level, the glass will hold its contents. Get greedy and
                fill more, it will empty everything with a vengeance, there is
                nothing one can do. Now, that is an application and that is why
                we love it - A fun, scientific toy that involves simple
                craftsmanship and takes a jab at a complex social problem of
                greed. That is high art. Which is what we want to be in the
                field of education.
