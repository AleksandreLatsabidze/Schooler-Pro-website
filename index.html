          <h1>The Schools need is a new age tool</h1>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
              Team SchoolerPro was born out of the desperation, doubt and
              anxiety that affected schools when COVID19 became a reality. But
              it is designed to outlast not only outlast the pandemic but also
              re-imagine pedagogy for the New Generation of Students. Indian
              Schools, though may face a lot of criticism for the means of
              imparting education, they still remain the powerhouse of educating
              so many students.
            </p>
            <p>
              At SchoolerPro, we believe that what the Schools need is a new age
              tool, that helps in managing content and making it seamlessly
              available for their students to consume. SchoolerPro is imagined
              as a platform that unites - Teacher, Students, Administrators,
              Third Party content creator with the sole aim of re-inventing a
              childs education. All this without burning the pockets of parents
              in a pay-as-you-go model.
