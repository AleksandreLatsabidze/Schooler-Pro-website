              Team SchoolerPro was born out of the desperation, doubt and
              anxiety that affected schools when COVID19 became a reality. But
              it is designed to outlast not only outlast the pandemic but also
              re-imagine pedagogy for the New Generation of Students. Indian
              Schools, though may face a lot of criticism for the means of
              imparting education, they still remain the powerhouse of educating
              so many students.
            </p>
            <p>
              At SchoolerPro, we believe that what the Schools need is a new age
              tool, that helps in managing content and making it seamlessly
              available for their students to consume. SchoolerPro is imagined
              as a platform that unites - Teacher, Students, Administrators,
              Third Party content creator with the sole aim of re-inventing a
              childs education. All this without burning the pockets of parents
              in a pay-as-you-go model.

            <h3>Creating tomorrow's solutions for today.</h3>
            <h2>
              At SchoolerPro, we believe in creating tomorrowâ€™s solutions for
              today. Education in India has always been a fast-paced industry
              where huge numbers are pitted against each other by institutions
              and upcoming EdTech Startups alike. We Beg to Differ. We are a
              platform that lets every teacher enhance her lesson and every
              student learn in a digital, real-world and scaleable way. Nature
              has already done a great job of already giving the kids a very
              plastic brain that just needs to be guided. We just have to keep
              feeding those guns and kids can imagine a world even better and
              smarter than us. Our logo emphasises our approach - Emphasise
              Application. Our logo is designed from a rather simple invention
              of a well known learned man. Pythagoras is so well known in India,
              thanks to his a^2 + b^2 = c^2 formula. In a poetically infamous
              way, this marks the single greatest rote-learned formula by many
              students in India. But Pythagoras is more than meets the eye. He
              loved the application of things with as much passion as he learned
              them. Our logo is based on a Pythagoras Cup. When filled under a
              certain level, the glass will hold its contents. Get greedy and
              fill more, it will empty everything with a vengeance, there is
              nothing one can do. Now, that is an application and that is why we
              love it - A fun, scientific toy that involves simple craftsmanship
              and takes a jab at a complex social problem of greed. That is high
              art. Which is what we want to be in the field of education.
